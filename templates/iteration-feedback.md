# Follow-up Plan – {{scope}}/{{iteration}}

## Summary
- Parent iteration: {{parent_iteration}}
- Decision: 🔄 ITERATE
- Reviewer: Orchestrator ({{date}})
- Attempts used: {{attempts_used}} of 3
- Remaining: {{attempts_remaining}}

## Code Verification (by Orchestrator)

**Claimed in results.md:**
- [What implementation session documented as completed]

**Actual changes found in code:**
- [What actually exists in the files]

**Assessment:**
- Documentation accuracy: [Match / Partial / Mismatch]
- Code quality: [Observations about maintainability, patterns, architecture]
- Completeness: [What's done, what's incomplete, what's missing]

## Issues to Address

1. **[Issue Title]**
   - **Impact:** [Brief description of impact]
   - **Required fix:** [Specific, concrete fix needed]

2. **[Issue Title]**
   - **Impact:** [Brief description]
   - **Required fix:** [Specific fix]

3. **[Issue Title]** (max 3 issues)
   - **Impact:** [Brief description]
   - **Required fix:** [Specific fix]

## Updated Acceptance Criteria

**CRITICAL:** Criteria remain FROZEN from original iteration_plan.md
- [ ] [Original criterion 1] (unchanged)
- [ ] [Original criterion 2] (unchanged)
- [ ] [Original criterion 3] (unchanged)

**Note:** New issues discovered → backlog, NOT added to this iteration

## Validation Requirements
- Commands to run again: [List scoped validation commands]
- Manual QA expectations: [If any]

## Next Steps

1. Fix issues listed above (max 3)
2. Run `/ap_exec {{scope}} {{iteration}}`
3. Orchestrator reviews against ORIGINAL criteria
4. If iteration_01_c reached, must escalate to human

## Notes
- **Iteration budget:** {{attempts_remaining}} attempts left before escalation
- **Criteria:** Evaluate against ORIGINAL only (no new requirements)
- **Escalation:** If blockers found, use BLOCK decision instead of creating more iterations
